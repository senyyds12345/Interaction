# Interaction
- This program is an interactive runner that allows you to quickly run Java, C++, PHP, JavaScript, and Python.
# install
- Use  `dpkg-deb build`  to package it into a DEB file.
```dpkg-deb build Interaction```
- If you are using Termux, we cannot install this DEB package with  dpkg -i —this is because Android does not allow the installation of system packages. Therefore, we use the "moving files" method for installation.
1.unzip
```dpkg -x Interaction.deb extracted/```
2.moving
```cp extracted/usr/local/bin/interaction $PREFIX/bin/```
3.Grant executable permissions
```chmod +x $PREFIX/bin/interaction```
- After completing the above operations, you can use  interaction  to run the program.
- Currently, there are ready-to-use DEB packages available in the Release description for you to download directly.
## use
- You can execute the program using the  `interaction`  command after installing it.
- After running the program, you will be prompted to enter "y" or "n":
 
- "n" means to exit;
​
- "y" means to start and download dependencies.
 
- Once the download is complete, you can enter the Java filename to run the Java program quickly.
- Enter "cpp", "php", "js", or "python" to enter the corresponding running mode. The operation is consistent with the Java mode, and you can return to the Java mode using the "quit" command.
- You can exit the program via "quit".
